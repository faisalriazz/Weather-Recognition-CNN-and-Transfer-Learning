# Weather Recognition using Custom CNN  and Different Transfer Learning Model
Originally the paper was published in 2018 , Code implemented in Matlab. Using the same dataset used in this paper, i have created three models one
Custom CNN model using Keras. Two other models are implemented using the Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 and VGG19.

## Dataset
https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/top-10-image-classification-datasets-for-machine-learning/

## Code 
Code is written in Python and contains Jupyter Notebooks. You can run the code in Google Colab.

## Problem Soltuion 
Problem is actually an image classfication problems solved with Convolution Neural Networks usin Keras.
